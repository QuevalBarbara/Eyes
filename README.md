<h1>Eyes</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>During the week 8, we had to create a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement. For this activity we had to bring together our skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository into your local environment</li>
<li>Open the index.html file</li>
<li>Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
<p>I plan to work on make the eyes squint when the mouse is between them.</p>
